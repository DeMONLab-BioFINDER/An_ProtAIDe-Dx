## Background
The rapid growth in the dementia population underscores the urgent need for accessible and scalable biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases. These biomarkers are crucial for improving early diagnosis, confirming (co-)pathologies, and optimizing participant selection in clinical trials. This highlights the pressing need for a one-shot, multi-disease biomarker panel that is minimally invasive, cost-effective, and widely accessible. In this paper, we introduce such a panel, leveraging state-of-the-art AI techniques **ProtAIDe-Dx** to analyze complex, high-dimensional proteomics data from the GNPC, the largest neurodegenerative disease proteomics dataset to date (n=17,170).
